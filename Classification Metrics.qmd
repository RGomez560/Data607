# Approach

## Introduction

Review the provided materials in order to develop a machine learning classification model and then develop metrics in order to evaluate the model.

## Challenges

This will be my first time developing an ML classification model and metrics for the model but I have developed other kinds of models in the past so I hope that it is not too complicated.

# Base Code
