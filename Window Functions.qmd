## Introduction

The goal of this assignment is to use a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate artificial time series data in the health domain. This dataset will then be analyzed in R to calculate year-to-year averages and a six-day moving average for all relevant items.

## Challenges

Although I have used LLMs before, I have not applied them to create artificial datasets. I hope this will not be too challenging. If I am unsuccessful, I may need to find a free dataset as an alternative, which could delay my progress on the assignment.
